I need help with this repl.

About it:
when I type in bash: 
    python3 main.py & 

the bash types:
    [1] 4112

and if I want to kill it, I run: 
    kill 4112

I need help with getting this (4112) to variable and running kill variable with the thing.

and I also need hepl with realising php site, which main.py will listen to and get information whether to kill the script or not.
